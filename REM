# Remove TODO.md from GitHub - Option 1: Complete Removal

## Method 1: Delete the file completely (recommended for this case)

```bash
# 1. Delete the file locally
rm TODO.md

# 2. Stage the deletion
git rm TODO.md

# 3. Commit the deletion
git commit -m "Remove TODO.md - task tracking file"

# 4. Push the changes
git push origin feature/fix-authcontext-mismatch
```

## Method 2: Add to .gitignore (if you want to keep the file locally but not track it)

```bash
# 1. Add TODO.md to .gitignore
echo "TODO.md" >> .gitignore

# 2. Stage .gitignore
git add .gitignore

# 3. Commit the change
git commit -m "Add TODO.md to .gitignore"

# 4. Push the changes
git push origin feature/fix-authcontext-mismatch
```

## Current Status
- TODO.md is currently modified (M in git status)
- It's already committed in the current branch
- Need to decide which approach to use
